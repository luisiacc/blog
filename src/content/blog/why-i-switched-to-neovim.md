I finally took the plunge and switched to Neovim full-time.

## The learning curve

It took about two weeks to feel productive. Worth it.

## What I gained

- Speed. Everything is faster.
- Focus. No distractions.
- Customization. It's truly mine.

## What I miss

Honestly, not much. The LSP support is excellent now.

## My config

I use lazy.nvim for plugin management and keep things minimal.
