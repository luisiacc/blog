Here's my current terminal setup that I've refined over the years.

## Shell: zsh with minimal config

I keep my `.zshrc` simple. No fancy frameworks, just a few aliases.

## Key tools

- **fzf** - fuzzy finding everything
- **ripgrep** - faster than grep
- **eza** - better ls
- **zoxide** - smarter cd

## Multiplexer

I use tmux with a simple config. Sessions for each project.
